knowledge base, done light.
===============================

People have facts
People want facts


Markdown + interviews + good search = sharing

Blogging sucks.  Reporting sucks.  Dashboards suck.

Guiding designs
- people are good at filtering
- facts are short
- tags and folksonomy, sort it out later

Output ideas:
- list of facts
- fact of the day
- pinboards ARE posters?


Sample input:

WHAT, by WHO, WHEN

- search, ux, firefox17, testpilot  <- search hooks, know how stale
- expires on :  when expires
- who, who_else  (always want a backup!)
- confidence?
- 20% of searches are by direct entry.


Far future concerns:
- styling
- images
- verification / trustworthiness / caveats?

Alternate name inspirations
- know
- fact / faq
- base
- smarty


MVP
-----

Goals:
- show value of fact search
- NOT show ease of entry

Evaluate:
- can this be done with some existing pinboard clone?

Requires:
- (assumption:  nothing existing exists)
- search of finite size (lunr.js?)
- entry by admin / backend
- web access point
- several facts
- NO DB (unless that is easier?  Standup tradeoffs!)
